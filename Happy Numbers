A happy number is a number defined by the following process:
Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until
the number either equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1.
Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers, while those that do not end in 1 are unhappy numbers.


The distinct combinations of digits that form happy numbers below 1,000 follow (the rest are just rearrangements and/or 
insertions of zero digits):
1, 7, 13, 19, 23, 28, 44, 49, 68, 79, 129, 133, 139, 167, 188, 226, 236, 239, 338, 356, 367, 368, 379, 446, 469, 478, 556,
566, 888, 899. 

 All non-happy numbers follow sequences that reach the cycle:
4, 16, 37, 58, 89, 145, 42, 20, 4, {\displaystyle \dots } \dots
