 Take any positive integer n. If n is even, divide it by 2 to get n / 2. 
 If n is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1 to obtain 3n + 1.
 Repeat the process (which has been called "Half Or Triple Plus One", or HOTPO[7]) indefinitely. 
 The conjecture is that no matter what number you start with, you will always eventually reach 1.
